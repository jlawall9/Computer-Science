# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
Galiga

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game where a player controlled ship shoots enemy ships, and possibly a boss

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
 
This game will be coded using pygame. The player will be able to play using the arrow or wasd keys. It will be executed through rounds or waves of enemies

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?
I will make sure to acomplish a functional galiga game, some obsicles may include the boss battle and heath, and separate waves on enemies

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1-2 basic rounds and a boss battle

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

no errors, over 5 rounds of enemies and 2 boss battles

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO
    I will need to research the library for pygame and basic video game code tips. I will look into youtube and webistes for help
