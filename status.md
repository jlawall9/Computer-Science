#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have made a very simple version of galaga, with full controlls of 
the player shit and enemies that move side to side. Lately, I have been working on
understanding how to implement sound, which took a while. but now i'm trying to 
figure out how to play the same saund twice using import vlc 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I have gotten the boss to spawn after the first level of enemies, but need to 
give it attacks, heath and movement

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Sound took a while, and stupid mistakes have definetly taken too much of my
time
